# Fixing the Kotlin Compose Plugin Issue

## Problem
The build was failing with the following error:
```
Plugin [id: 'org.jetbrains.kotlin.plugin.compose', version: '1.9.0', apply: false] was not found in any of the following sources
```

## Root Cause
There were two main issues:
1. The plugin ID was incorrect - `org.jetbrains.kotlin.plugin.compose` doesn't exist
2. The JetBrains Compose repository was not included in the project configuration

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated the Plugin ID
In `gradle/libs.versions.toml`, changed:
```toml
kotlin-compose = { id = "org.jetbrains.kotlin.plugin.compose", version.ref = "kotlin" }
```
to:
```toml
kotlin-compose = { id = "org.jetbrains.compose", version.ref = "compose" }
```

### 2. Added a Specific Version for the Compose Plugin
In `gradle/libs.versions.toml`, added:
```toml
compose = "1.5.3"
```
to the `[versions]` section.

### 3. Added the JetBrains Compose Repository
In `settings.gradle.kts`, added:
```kotlin
maven { url = uri("https://maven.pkg.jetbrains.space/public/p/compose/dev") }
```
to both the `pluginManagement.repositories` and `dependencyResolutionManagement.repositories` sections.

## Explanation
The JetBrains Compose plugin is separate from the Kotlin plugin and requires:
1. The correct plugin ID: `org.jetbrains.compose`
2. A specific version compatible with the Kotlin version
3. Access to the JetBrains Compose repository where the plugin is hosted

These changes ensure that Gradle can find and use the correct Compose plugin, allowing the build to complete successfully.

## Verification
The changes were verified by running `./gradlew tasks`, which completed successfully, indicating that all plugins could be resolved correctly.
